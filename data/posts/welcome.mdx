Hey there <span alt='peace out emoji' role="img">‚úåÔ∏è</span>

Welcome to my digital home.

Thank you for taking the time to check out what I'm building here.

It's not much at the time of writing, but I'm dedicated to putting in the effort to cultivating a truly unique online space.

My main intention is to create a space that is minimal at its core, but possesses the power to transform into a fully interactive experience.

Here are a couple of other intentions and hopes I have for this space:

- A place for people to learn about the things I care about.
- Somewhere I can share what I'm struggling with or I'm excited about in development and design.
- Creating an experience that is **accessible** to all.
- A space that I feel proud to share with the world.

There are many more, detailed visions and features I have in mind but in my time learning design and development, I've learnt that constraint can be very powerful when used intentionally.

**Continual improvement** is the name of the game here.

My approach this time round is to plan, design and build **incrementally**.

I'll be focusing on a feature at a time to ensure every idea is well nurtured and relevant towards providing an optimal experience for users.

I want my digital home to be somewhere people feel they'd like to come back and visit.

There are actually already a few key features I have in mind, so look out for these landing sometime soon:

1. A [digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) - a new approach to blogging.
2. Favourites - a list of things that deserve more than a bookmark.
3. Changelog - a great way to keep up with the changes happening in this space.
4. Micro-interactions - what's not to love about these?

As this is the first post here, I'll start wrapping up, as not to keep you too long.

Thanks again for taking the time to read this. It's also worth mentioning that this is an open-source project, so if you wish to contribute in any way, I'm only a pr away <span alt="wink emoji" role="img">üòâ</span> .

If you want to stay in touch with me, the best way would be via [email](mailto:gregogun97@gmail.com) or [discord](https://discord.gg/AenzEryw).

Guess I'll look forward to hearing from you!

Till then, I hope you enjoy your time here.
